# create-cloud-deploy-release

The `create-cloud-deploy-release` GitHub Action creates a [Cloud Deploy][cd]
[release][cd-release] to manage the deployment of an application to one or more
[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)][gke], [Anthos][anthos], or [Cloud Run][cloud-run]
[targets][cd-target].

## Prerequisites

-   This action requires Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to access
    the secrets being requested. See [Authorization](#authorization) for more
    information.

-   This action runs using Node 16. If you are using self-hosted GitHub Actions
    runners, you must use runner version
    [2.285.0](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) or newer.

-   This action depends on the existence of a [Cloud Deploy][cd]
    [delivery pipeline][cd-pipeline] that is configured for the targets to which
    the application will be deployed.

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    # ...

    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - uses: 'actions/checkout@v3'

    - uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v1'
      with:

        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

   - id: create-release
     uses: 'google-github-actions/create-cloud-deploy-release@v1'
      with:
        name: 'demo-app-v1.2.3'
        description: 'Add new functionality to demo-app'
        delivery_pipeline: 'demo-app-pipeline'
        region: 'us-central1'
        images: 'demo-app=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/demo-app-project/demo-app-repo/demo-app:v1.2.3'
        source: 'demo-app'
```

## Inputs

-   `name`: (Required) The name for the release.

-   `delivery_pipeline` (Required): The [delivery pipeline][cd-pipeline] to use
    for the release.

-   `source`: (Required) The location of the files to be included in the
    release; typically application configuration manifests.

-   `build_artifacts`: (Required, unless providing `images`) Path to a
    [Skaffold output file][skaffold-output] containing the details of the
    application image(s) to be released.

-   `images`: (Required, unless providing `build_artifacts`) The details of the
    application image(s) to be released, in the format
    `image1=path/to/image1:v1@sha256:45db24`, for example:

    ```yaml
    with:
      images: |-
        image1=image.repo/path/to/image1:v1@sha256:45db24
        image2=image.repo/path/to/image2:v1@sha256:f32780
    ```

-   `region`: (Optional) Region of the delivery pipeline. If not supplied, a
    previously configured `gcloud` setting using `deploy/region` is required,
    for example `gcloud config set deploy/region [REGION]`.

-   `disable_initial_rollout`: (Optional) Prevent the release being deployed to
    the first target in the delivery pipeline.

-   `gcs_source_staging_dir`: (Optional) A directory in Google Cloud Storage to
    copy the source used for staging the build.

-   `skaffold_file`: (Optional) Path of the skaffold file absolute or relative
    to the source directory.

-   `annotations`: (Optional) Add additional annotations to the release.

    ```yaml
    with:
      annotations: |-
        annotation1=value1
        annotation2=value2
    ```

    The GitHub Action will automatically apply the following annotations to the
    release to enhance the user experience:

    ```text
    git-sha: ecdeca633a230bfade4cc8195ae23af030922319
    commit: <commit>
    ```

-   `labels`: (Optional) Add additional labels to the release.

    ```yaml
    with:
      labels: |-
        label1=value1
        label2=value2
    ```

    The GitHub Action will automatically apply the following label to the
    release to enhance the user experience:

    ```text
    managed-by: github-actions
    ```

    Labels have strict naming and casing requirements. See [Requirements for
    labels](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements)
    for more information.

-   `description`: (Optional) Include a description of the release.

-   `flags`: (Optional) Space separated list of other Cloud Deploy flags,
    examples can be found [here][cd-flags]. This can be used to access features
    that are not exposed via this GitHub Action.

    ```yaml
    with:
      flags: '--from-k8s-manifest=...'
    ```

-   `gcloud_version`: (Optional) Version of the Cloud SDK to install. If
    unspecified or set to "latest", the latest available gcloud SDK version for
    the target platform will be installed. Example: "290.0.1".

-   `gcloud_component`: (Optional) Version of the Cloud SDK components to
    install and use. If unspecified, the latest or released version will be
    used. This is the equivalent of running 'gcloud alpha run' or 'gcloud beta
    run'. Valid values are `alpha` or `beta`.

## Outputs

-   `name`: The full name of the release in Cloud Deploy, including project and
    pipeline names, as well as the chosen name of the release itself.

-   `link`: A link to the Cloud Deploy release in the Google Cloud Web Console.

## Authorization

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. The caller must have
permissions to access the secrets being requested.

### Via google-github-actions/auth

Use [google-github-actions/auth](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth)
to authenticate the action. You can use [Workload Identity Federation][wif] or
traditional [Service Account Key JSON][sa] authentication.

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:

    # ...

    - uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v1'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - uses: 'google-github-actions/create-cloud-deploy-release@v1'
      with:
        name: 'example-app'
        ...
```

### Via Application Default Credentials

If you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,
you can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will
authenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This
only works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    steps:
    # ...

    - uses: 'google-github-actions/create-cloud-deploy-release@v1'
      with:
        name: 'example-app'
        ...
```

The action will automatically detect and use the Application Default
Credentials.

### Cloud Deploy Release Creation

To use the default Cloud Deploy configuration you will need to authenticate to
Google Cloud as a service account with the following roles:

-   Cloud Deploy Releaser (`roles/clouddeploy.releaser`)
    -   To create and retrieve releases and rollouts
-   Cloud Storage Admin (`roles/storage.admin`)
    -   To write release packages

This is in addition to any other roles that may be needed earlier in the
pipeline, for example `roles/artifactregistry.writer` to allow images to be
pushed to Artifact Registry.

By default, Cloud Deploy itself will use the `Compute Engine default service
account`, `PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com` as described
in the documentation for [IAM within Cloud Deploy][cd-iam], though for
production use-cases it's recommended that you create one or more dedicated service
accounts [as detailed in the Cloud Deploy documentation][cd-custom-sa]. A custom
service account can be granted the `roles/clouddeploy.jobRunner` role in the Cloud
Deploy project to enable required permissions.

You may find that Organizational Policy rules prevent certain permissions being
assigned to default service accounts. In this case please consult with your
organization administrators.

By default the service account used by Cloud Deploy requires the following roles:

-   Cloud Logging Writer (`roles/logging.logWriter`)
    -   To write logs
-   Cloud Storage Viewer (`storage/object.viewer`)
    -   To read Cloud Deploy artifacts
-   Cloud Storage Creator (`storage/object.creator`)
    -   To write Cloud Deploy artifacts

Depending on your Cloud Deploy configuration you may choose to create more
granular roles for custom resources, rather than relying on the default.

The service account used by Cloud Deploy additionally needs permisisons that
allow deployment of a service to your target runtime, [GKE][gke] or
[Cloud Run][cloud-run], as described in the following sections. This could be:

-   The default compute service account
-   The same custom service account you created for release creation, or
-   A separate custom service account dedicated to deployment.

### Cloud Run Authorization

To deploy to Cloud Run, the service account used by Cloud Deploy needs the
following permissions:

-   Cloud Run Developer (`roles/run.developer`)
    -   Read and write access to all Cloud Run resources.

The service account additionally needs to be a member of the service account
used by Cloud Run, with role `Service Account User`. This may be the `Compute
Engine default service account, (PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com)`
or a custom service account, depending on your configuration. To grant
`iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permissions for a service account, use one of the methods
found in [the IAM documentation][sa-ownership-and-access].

### GKE Authorization

To deploy to GKE, the service account used by Cloud Deploy needs the following permissions:

-   Kubernetes Engine Developer (`roles/container.developer`)
    -   Provides access to Kubernetes API objects inside clusters.

In all cases, you should follow the principle of least privilege when assigning
IAM roles. When possible, grant roles at the resource level as opposed to the
project level.

## Example Workflows

-   [Example workflows][examples] for `create-cloud-deploy-release`

## Versioning

We recommend pinning to the latest available major version:

```yaml
- uses: 'google-github-actions/create-cloud-deploy-release@v1'
```

While this action attempts to follow semantic versioning, but we're ultimately
human and sometimes make mistakes. To prevent accidental breaking changes, you
can also pin to a specific version:

```yaml
- uses: 'google-github-actions/create-cloud-deploy-release@v1.0.0'
```

However, you will not get automatic security updates or new features without
explicitly updating your version number. Note that we only publish `MAJOR` and
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions. There is **not** a floating alias for
`MAJOR.MINOR`.
